# RDWC2018

This is the raw codebase for the Ranking and Scheduling code for the Roller Derby World Cup 2018

It consists of three interlinked sets of code:

1) an implementation of power rankings (cf Massey) for correctly scheduled roller derby tournaments

2) a maximum-weight, maximum-cardinality matching algorithm for generating "optimal" matches for competitors

3) a block scheduler for placement of matches in a round so as to provide minimum interference

[There is also a bracket generator used for RDWC2018, but that just takes the seeds as the resulting power rankings after the final round here.]
